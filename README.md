# Deadlock and Concurrency Algorithms

## Description

### Deadlock 
Deadlock is a situation where a set of processes are blocked because each process is
holding a resource and waiting for another resource acquired by some other process.

### Concurrency 
Concurrency is the execution of the multiple instruction sequences at the same time.
It happens in the operating system when there are several process threads running
in parallel.

The following website consists of various deadlock and concurrency algorithms. These
are implemented using html, css and javascript on visual code studio.
