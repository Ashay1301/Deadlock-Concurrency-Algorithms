# Deadlock and Concurrency Algorithms

## Description

### Deadlock 
Deadlock is a situation where a set of processes are blocked because each process is
holding a resource and waiting for another resource acquired by some other process.

### Concurrency 
Concurrency is the execution of the multiple instruction sequences at the same time.
It happens in the operating system when there are several process threads running
in parallel.

#
The following website consists of various deadlock and concurrency algorithms. These
are implemented using html, css and javascript on visual code studio.

There are 8 algorithms with visualizations

## 1. MuteX
Mutex is a mutual exclusion object that synchronizes access to a resource.
It is created with a unique name at the start of a program. The Mutex is a locking mechanism that makes sure
only one thread can acquire the Mutex at a time and enter the critical section.

## 2. Counting Semaphore
Conceptually, a semaphore is a nonnegative integer count. Semaphores are typically used to coordinate access to
resources, with the semaphore count initialized to the number of free resources.
By default, there is no defined order of unblocking if multiple threads are waiting for a semaphore

## 3. Producer Consumer
The producer consumer problem is a synchronization problem.
There is a fixed size buffer and the producer produces items and enters them into the buffer.
The consumer removes the items from the buffer and consumes them.

## 4. Lock Variable
Two values of lock can be possible, either 0 or 1.
Lock value 0 means that the critical section is vacant while the lock value 1 means that it is occupied.
A process which wants to get into the critical section first checks the value of the lock variable.

## 5. Binary Semaphore
A binary semaphore is restricted to values of zero or one, while a counting semaphore can assume any nonnegative
integer value.
A binary semaphore can be used to control access to a single resource.
In particular, it can be used to enforce mutual exclusion for a critical section in user code.

## 6. Peterson' Algorithm
Peterson's algorithm (or Peterson's solution) is a concurrent programming algorithm for mutual exclusion that allows
two or more processes to share a single-use resource without conflict, using only shared memory for communication.

## 7. Test and Set
In Process Synchronization, Test and Set Lock (TSL) is a synchronization mechanism that uses a test-and-set instruction
to provide the synchronization among the processes.
It ensures mutual exclusion and freedom from deadlock.

## 8. Banker's Algorithm
A binary semaphore is restricted to values of zero or one, while a counting semaphore can assume any nonnegative
integer value.
A binary semaphore can be used to control access to a single resource.
In particular, it can be used to enforce mutual exclusion for a critical section in user code.
